# ascii2048
terminal based C++ clone of 2048 game

Sick of intuitive javascript web-apps and newfangled touchscreen interfaces?
Want to get maximum performance out of your simple arithmetical games?

This clone of 2048 was made mainly as an exercise in classes and
memory management.

It has so far only been compiled and run on unix-based systems
using clang++ and g++.

The compile script uses clang++, and should produce an executable named "2048"
