# ascii2048
terminal based C++ clone of 2048 game

Sick of intuitive javascript web-apps and newfangled touchscreen interfaces?
Want to get maximum performance out of your simple arithmetical games?

This clone of 2048 was made as an exercise in classes and
memory management by a brand-new programmer. 

The compile script uses clang++, and produces an executable named "2048"
