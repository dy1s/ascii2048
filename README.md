# ascii2048
terminal based C++ clone of 2048 game

Sick of intuitive javascript apps and touchscreen interfaces?
Want to get maximum performance out of your simple arithmetical games?

This clone of 2048 was made mainly as an exercise in classes and
memory management.

It has so far only been compiled and run on unix-based systems
using clang++ and gcc.

To compile use "clang++ main.cpp game.cpp grid.cpp"
To run- "./a.out"


Initial implementation included management and sorting of high scores
to comply with a homework assignment spec; features have been commented
out as of 5/7/17.
